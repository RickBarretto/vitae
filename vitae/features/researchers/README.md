# Researchers

This is the **core domain** of the project and the most complex feature implemented so far.

Its main responsibility is to provide a **Web UI for non-technical users** to search, filter, and explore researchers, and then **export their connections to the Lucy Lattes** platform.

## Backend

The backend is built using **FastAPI**, chosen for its:

- Great development experience
- Clean and good defaults
- Fast iteration for building new features
- Lightweight, micro-framework design (as opposed to the heavier Django stack)

FastAPI allows us to focus on feature delivery without unnecessary overhead. It integrates well with Pythonâ€™s ecosystem and fits the Vertical Slice model well.

The feature uses the **shared SQLModel-based database**, with no separate data store.

## Frontend

The frontend uses **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** to eliminate the need for a JavaScript bundler or runtime like NPM, Node, or Deno. Since one of the project's constraints is to be easy to ship, and I think this wouldn't be as I want if multiple runtimes are required.

- The initial implementation used **Jinja2 templates**, but as complexity increased, maintenance became difficult.
- Templates were replaced with **JinjaX components**, which offer:
    - Isolated and reusable components
    - A cleaner, React-inspired syntax
    - Easier readability and maintainability

This architectural decision drastically improved development speed and UI consistency.

## Highlights

### Web

- `routes.py`: Defines all FastAPI HTTP endpoints for this feature.
- `templates.py`: Sets up and configures Jinja2/JinjaX environments.
- `templates/`: Contains all JinjaX components and page layouts shown to users.
- `schemas/`: Defines Pydantic schemas used for data transfer between backend, frontend, and domain layers.

### Domain

- `usecases/`: Contains the main application logic for querying and processing researcher data.
- `models/`: Holds the rich domain models that encapsulate the core business rules.
- `repository/`: 
    - Defines and implements repository interfaces for database operations.
    - Uses `database.session` directly for fine-grained transaction control.
    - Responsible for mapping database schemas to domain models.
